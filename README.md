This python script adds a balloon to an image. The resulting image is scaled to 520 pixels wide (good for Twitter). 

In the file `points.json` specify the vertex for the balloon, the text string, and the lower-left corner for the text string.

Requires the Python [wand](https://pypi.org/project/Wand/) package.
